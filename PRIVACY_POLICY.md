# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. It is Control.NET policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you through our app, Miunie.

We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it on your local machine by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will be used. Your data will only be sent to Discord and will never be collected by us.

We only retain collected information on your machine for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data we store, we’ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

We cannot share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, since all of your data is on your machine and is only accessed for ease of use purposes by the locally running application.

Our app may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.

You are free to refuse our request for your personal information, with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services.

Your continued use of our application will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact us.

This policy is effective as of 3 March 2020.
